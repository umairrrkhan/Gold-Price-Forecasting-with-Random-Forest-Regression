# Gold Price Forecasting with Random Forest Regression

## Overview

This project aims to predict the future prices of gold using a Random Forest Regression model. The goal is to leverage historical gold price data and various features to build a predictive model that can help forecast gold prices.

2. **Installation**
    To run this project, you'll need to have the following Python libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3. **Usage**
    To use this project, follow these steps:
    1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (see the Installation section).
    3. Run the Jupyter notebook `gold_price_forecast.ipynb`.
    The notebook contains detailed comments explaining each step of the process, from loading the data to training the Random Forest Regression model and 
    making predictions.

4. **Data**
    The dataset used in this project is `gold_price_data.csv`. It contains historical gold price data along with relevant features for predicting gold prices.

5. **Methodology**
    We used a Random Forest Regression model to predict gold prices. Here's a high-level overview of the methodology:
    1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned and any missing values were handled appropriately. Feature selection and engineering were performed to 
                               create relevant input features for the model.
    2. **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.
    3. **Random Forest Regression**: We used the `RandomForestRegressor` from scikit-learn to build the predictive model. The model was trained using the 
                                     training data.
    4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

6. **Results**

The model's predictions and performance metrics can be found in the `gold_price_forecast_results.csv` file in the `output` directory. Additionally, visualizations of the model's performance are available in the `gold_price_forecast_visualizations.png` file in the same directory.

7. **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the application of Random Forest Regression for gold price forecasting. The results and insights gained from this model can be useful for individuals and organizations interested in the gold market.
